# ts-jsx-react-sample

A very simple web project template which makes use of the following tools:

- React
- TypeScript
- Sass
- gulp
- (TODO: Node.js)
- (TODO: Express)

The IDE being used was Visual Studio Code.

## Running the sample

To compile and bundle everything:

	cd ts-jsx-react-sample/
	npm install
	gulp

To run the client-side piece:

	cd dist/client
	npm install -g http-server
	http-server -p 3000

Then visit http://localhost:3000 to see it in action.
